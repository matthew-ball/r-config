# R Config

This repository contains scripts for setting up R, RStudio, and common R packages on a fresh Ubuntu system.

Importantly, this setup has not been tested, but I assume it works.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install R and RStudio

Run the following shell scripts:

- `./install_r.sh` and `install_rstudio.sh`

### 2. Install R packages

Run the `install_packages.sh` script to install the necessary R packages.
